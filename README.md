## Brain tumor detection

* This is a streamlit web app that uses Machine Learning to determine whether or not a person has brain tumor.
* The notebook for the model training process is also in this repository.
* The model is a convolutional neural network model trained using Tensorflow and python.
* I also employed transfer learning technique using tensorflow's built-in VGG16 algorithm with pretrained weights.


### Use case
I believe this model is important in situations or areas where there are fewer doctors or fewer doctors with experience
